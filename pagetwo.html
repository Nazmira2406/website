<p align="center" style="font-family:Lithos Pro;font-size:25px">Mary Anderson, the inventor of the windshield wipers, was born in Greene County, Alabama in 1866. In 1889, she moved with her sister and widowed mother to Birmingham, Alabama and later became a real estate agent. In 1903, while visiting New York, she found that she was struggling to see signs due to the harsh weather. her driver also had a difficult time seeing clearly while driving. Her driver drove with both front car windows open and using hands, wiped the snow and ice off the windshield. This inspired Anderson and she began drawing up plans to design an improved methodof her drivers idea to clear the windshield.</p>

<p align="center" style="font-family:Lithos Pro;font-size:25px">Anderson designed a rubber blade in 1903. It was initially made of rubber and wood and had a lever that could be operated from inside the car by the driver, which was attached near the steering wheel, had an 'arm' which was the rubber blade that was connected to a spring and would slide accross the winshield and back to its origanal place, cleaning the windshield. This invention could easily be attached and removed from the car.</p>

<p align="center" style="font-family:Lithos Pro;font-size:25px">Many people laughed and made fun of Andersons invention. She had tried to sell her invention to a Canadian manufacturingfirm, buy they did not buy her idea as they claimed that it had 'no practical value'. By 1913, mechanical windshield wipers became standard equipment for cars. Anderson did not make any profit from her design. Today, it is almost impossible to imaginehaving a car without windshield wipers. </p>

<p align="center" style="font-family:Lithos Pro;font-size:25px">Josephine Cochrane is the inventor of everyones favourite kitchen item, the dushwasher. Joesphine was born in Ashtabula County, Ohio in 1839. Her father was a civil engineer and her great grandfather was an inventor. Josephine and her husband, William, often had guests at their home. Even though Josephine had workers that did most of her housework, she still came up and designed the very fisrt successful dishwasher after realizimg that her fine china was being chipped while being cleaned in the sink. Josephine tried to wash the china by hand, herself, but found that ut was time consuming and burdening and decided to go searching for an easier and better way.</p>
<p align="center" style="font-family:Lithos Pro;font-size:25px">Josephine created her own design. It had water jets and a dishrack. Josephines husband passed away shortly after she began designing her dishwasher and this left her in debt. This was what gave her the push to drive her to create a successful machine. Josephine worked in the shed behind her home. She measured her dishes and using wire constructed compartments to fit all of her tableware which laid flat within a copper boiler. The wheel was powered by a motor and would turn while soapy water was squirted onto the dishes, cleaning them. </p>
<p align="center" style="font-family:Lithos Pro;font-size:25px">In 1886, she began making the design for her friends and advertising it in local newspapers as the "Cochrane Crescent Washing Machine Company" and entered her machine at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893 where she won an award for its durability and design. Her invention sold well to business' as women claimed to have enjoyed washing dishes by hand at home, but by the 1950's sales skyrocketed today a dishwasher is a common kitchen item that is part of many households.</p>
